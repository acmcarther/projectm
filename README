ProjectM is a bash tool to help manage switching between various projects.
It does this by intelligently detecting the "root" of the project, and making various
files available, such as a project-specific .gitignore, .ackignore, and other configs.
It also sources a .project file to find the name of the project and allow definition and presence
of project-specific aliases and helpers. All availble only when you'd need them!

to use, add ". ~/utils/tools/projectm/init.sh" to your bashrc, zshrc, kshrc, or whatever you use. ;)
